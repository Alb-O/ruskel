# Ripdoc

Ripdoc produces a syntactical outline of a crate's public API and documentation. The CLI provides on-demand access to these resources from any source (local filesystem or through [crates.io](https://crates.io)), perfect for AI agent usage.

## Search Mode

Use `--search`|`-s` to focus on specific items instead of rendering an entire crate. The query runs across multiple domains and returns the public API containing the matches and their ancestors for context.

```sh
# Show methods and fields matching "status" within the reqwest crate
ripdoc reqwest --search status --search-spec name,signature
```

By default the query matches the name, doc, and signature domains with case-insensitive comparisons. Include the optional `path` domain when you need canonical path matches by passing `--search-spec name,path`, or use `--search-spec doc` to inspect documentation only. Combine with `--search-case-sensitive` to require exact letter case.

Add `--direct-match-only`|`-d` when you want container matches (modules, structs, traits) to stay collapsed and show only the exact hits.

The search output respects existing flags like `--private`, feature controls, and syntax highlighting options.

## Listing Mode

Use `--list`|`-l` to print a concise catalog of crate items instead of rendering Rust code. Each line reports the item kind and its fully qualified path:

```sh
# Survey the high-level structure of tokio without emitting code
ripdoc tokio --list

crate      crate
module     crate::sync
struct     crate::sync::Mutex
trait      crate::io::AsyncRead
```

Combine `--list` with `--search` to filter the catalog using the same domain controls as skeleton search. The listing honours `--private` and feature flags, and it conflicts with `--raw` because the output is tabular text rather than Rust code.

Below is a small excerpt from the `pandoc` crate showing how Ripdoc renders the same snippet in Markdown (default) and in the raw Rust skeleton (`--format rs`):

### Markdown preview (default):

````markdown
```rust
impl Pandoc {
```

Get a new Pandoc object This function returns a builder object to configure the Pandoc execution.

```rust
pub fn new() -> Pandoc {}
```

Add a path hint to search for the LaTeX executable.

The supplied path is searched first for the latex executable, then the environment variable `PATH`, then some hard-coded location hints.

```rust
pub fn add_latex_path_hint<T: AsRef<Path> + ?Sized>(&mut self, path: &T) -> &mut Pandoc {}
```

Add a path hint to search for the Pandoc executable.

The supplied path is searched first for the Pandoc executable, then the environment variable `PATH`, then some hard-coded location hints.

```rust
pub fn add_pandoc_path_hint<T: AsRef<Path> + ?Sized>(&mut self, path: &T) -> &mut Pandoc {}

// Set or overwrite the document-class.
pub fn set_doc_class(&mut self, class: DocumentClass) -> &mut Pandoc {}
```
````

### Rust preview (`--format rs`):

```rust
impl Pandoc {
    /// Get a new Pandoc object
    /// This function returns a builder object to configure the Pandoc
    /// execution.
    pub fn new() -> Pandoc {}

    /// Add a path hint to search for the LaTeX executable.
    ///
    /// The supplied path is searched first for the latex executable, then the environment variable
    /// `PATH`, then some hard-coded location hints.
    pub fn add_latex_path_hint<T: AsRef<Path> + ?Sized>(&mut self, path: &T) -> &mut Pandoc {}

    /// Add a path hint to search for the Pandoc executable.
    ///
    /// The supplied path is searched first for the Pandoc executable, then the environment variable `PATH`, then
    /// some hard-coded location hints.
    pub fn add_pandoc_path_hint<T: AsRef<Path> + ?Sized>(&mut self, path: &T) -> &mut Pandoc {}

    /// Set or overwrite the document-class.
    pub fn set_doc_class(&mut self, class: DocumentClass) -> &mut Pandoc {}
```

Ripdoc renders Markdown by default as it is more token efficient. The output is immediately usable for feeding to LLMs.

## Features

- Support for both local crates and remote crates from crates.io
- Filter output to matched items using `--search` with the `--search-spec` domain selector and `--direct-match-only` when you want to avoid container expansion
- Generate tabular item listings with `--list`, optionally filtered by `--search`
- Search match highlighting for terminal output
- Markdown-friendly output, which strips doc markers and wraps code in fenced `rust` blocks (use `--format rs` for raw Rust output)
- Optionally include private items and auto-implemented traits
- Support for querying against feature flags and version specification

## Requirements

Ripdoc requires the Rust nightly toolchain for its operation:

- **Nightly toolchain**: Required for unstable rustdoc features used to generate JSON documentation

Install the nightly toolchain:

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

## Installation

To install Ripdoc, run:

```sh
cargo install ripdoc
```

Note: While ripdoc requires the nightly toolchain to run, you can install it using any toolchain.

## Usage

Basic usage:

```sh
ripdoc [TARGET]
```

See the help output for all options:

```sh
ripdoc --help
```

Ripdoc has a flexible target specification that tries to do the right thing in a wide set of circumstances.

```sh
# Current project
ripdoc

# If we're in a workspace and we have a crate mypacakage
ripdoc mypackage

# A dependency of the current project, else we fetch from crates.io
ripdoc serde

# A sub-path within a crate
ripdoc serde::de::Deserialize

# Path to a crate
ripdoc /my/path

# A module within that crate
ripdoc /my/path::foo

# A crate from crates.io with a specific version
ripdoc serde@1.0.0

# Search for "status" across names, signatures and doc comments
ripdoc reqwest --search status

# Search for "status" in only names and signatures
ripdoc reqwest --search status --search-spec name,signature

# Search for "status" in docs only
ripdoc reqwest --search status --search-spec doc

# Render Markdown output with stripped doc comment markers
ripdoc serde --format markdown
```

## Experimental Hot Interpreter (PoC)

The workspace also bundles an experimental Rust “interpreter” that demonstrates Subsecond-powered hotpatching. The binary is compile-gated behind the `hot-interpreter` feature and lives inside `ripdoc-cli`.

```sh
cargo run -p ripdoc-cli --features hot-interpreter --bin hotinterp path/to/script.rs
```

`hotinterp` watches the provided script file, generates a tiny helper crate that links against [`subsecond`](https://crates.io/crates/subsecond), and reloads the resulting dynamic library whenever you save. The entrypoint is wrapped in `subsecond::call`, so when you rebuild the generated crate (triggered automatically on save) the running session is rewound to the interpreter entrypoint instead of restarting the host process.

Scripts are regular Rust modules. Define `pub fn hot_main(ctx: &mut ScriptContext) -> anyhow::Result<()>` and use the shared `ScriptContext` helper to stash state across reloads:

```rust
use crate::ScriptContext; // provided by the generated crate

pub fn hot_main(ctx: &mut ScriptContext) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let tick = ctx.cycle();
    ctx.emit_line(format!("tick #{tick}"));

    if tick == 0 {
        ctx.set_number("sum", 0.0);
    }

    let sum = ctx.number("sum").unwrap_or(0.0) + 1.5;
    ctx.set_number("sum", sum);
    ctx.emit_line(format!("running sum: {sum}"));
    ctx.set_text("status", "alive");
    Ok(())
}
```

`ScriptContext` offers a handful of batteries-included helpers:

- `emit_line(&str)` buffers a line that `hotinterp` prints after each run.
- `cycle()` reports how many times the script has executed (across reloads).
- `set_number` / `number` store simple floating-point registers.
- `set_text` / `text` do the same for string state.

Flags:

- `--once` runs the script one time and exits.
- `--release` compiles the generated helper crate in release mode (default is dev for faster rebuilds).

This PoC is intentionally small, but it sketches the workflow of editing a Rust “script”, saving, and letting Subsecond provide the hotpatch magic without restarting the host process.

## ripdoc-core library

`ripdoc-core` is a library that can be integrated into other Rust projects to provide Ripdoc functionality.

An example of using `ripdoc-core` in your Rust code:

```rust
use ripdoc_core::Ripdoc;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let ripdoc = Ripdoc::new().with_silent(true);
    let rendered = ripdoc.render(
        "serde",           // target
        false,             // no_default_features
        false,             // all_features
        Vec::new(),        // features
        false              // private_items
    )?;
    println!("{}", rendered);
    Ok(())
}
```

This crate is a forked and re-worked version of [cortesi's `ruskel`](https://github.com/cortesi/ruskel). Much of its core code is still in use.
